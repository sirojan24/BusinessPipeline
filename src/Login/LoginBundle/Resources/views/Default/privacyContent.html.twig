                        <p>PIPELINE99 ( "Pipeline99") is committed to protecting your privacy. We take privacy very seriously here at PIPELINE99 and post this PIPELINE99 Privacy & Security Policy ( "Policy ") to explain our policy and what PIPELINE99 does with the personal information that we collect from individuals that visit and use our website and the applications and services offered by PIPELINE99 (the "Services "). 


                        <h4>What Information We collect and Why</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <p>During your visit to the PIPELINE99 website, we may capture certain information about you. Upon sign up with PIPELINE99 (for a trial or for purchasing the service), you may be required to provide your first name, last name, billing address, email address, password, and login id (user name, which you create in the registration process). In addition, we may capture your company name, billing phone number, time zone, date format, time format and credit card information so you may subscribe to and pay for the Service, but we do not store any credit card information. All credit card information is stored by a third party credit card processor. All recurring credit card charges (either monthly or yearly) are authorized in advance by the customer. At sign up you also create your own log in id (user name) and password that is known only to you and PIPELINE99. PIPELINE99 strongly discourages the sharing of your login id (user name) and password with anyone. You, the Account Holder, are responsible for the safety and security of your login id (user name) and password.</p>

                            <p>Any information you or anyone with your login id (user name)and password upload into the Services in the form of files, contact information, industry knowledge, maps, financial information, and the like remains your sole and exclusive property, and we will not authorize any third party to access that information except as authorized pursuant to this Policy. Please note that this information is also subject to the PIPELINE99 Terms and Conditions of Use which may be found at http://www.pipeline99.com/termsofService.</p>

                            <p>As you navigate the PIPELINE99 website (whether or not you register as a user), information may be collected automatically through the use of commonly used information gathering tools such as cookies (embedded code that recognizes your browser), web beacons (clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information) and other existing or future tracking technology. Additionally, we collect standard information from your Web browser, such as browser type, your internet protocol address and actions you have taken on our website (i.e., pages viewed and clicked links). Periodically, PIPELINE99 may conduct webinars or other similar web events in which information may be collected. In order to participate in such events, you are required to provide your name, email address, number of employees, and how you heard about the web event. In addition, PIPELINE99 may capture the following information: address, phone number, industry, organization name and role in the purchase process. Generally speaking, the information we collect helps us provide the requested services and improve the website and deliver a better more personalized service to you. These collection tools and how they are used are described in further detail below.</p>

                        </ul>
						
						<h4>Your Privacy with Third Parties</h4>
						<ul>
						<p>PIPELINE99 may contain links to various other websites and enable interoperation of other applications and services that are not owned or controlled by PIPELINE99. Each of these other providers has a privacy policy that may differ from that of PIPELINE99. The privacy practices of such websites, applications and services not provided by PIPELINE99 are not covered by this Policy.</p>
						<p>PIPELINE99 will not disclose any of the personal information supplied to PIPELINE99 to any other third party except as expressly mentioned in this Policy, the Terms and Conditions of Use or as directed by you.</p>
						</ul>

						<h4>Our Policies on Email and Subscribing to the Service</h4>
						<ul>
						<p>PIPELINE99 does not support spamming over email by our Account Holders. If you would like to report an incident of email spamming, please contact us at customercare@pipeline99.com. We will investigate and take suitable action at our discretion. PIPELINE99 may send you marketing and other email communications from time to time including special offers, new features, new products or services, and referrals.

						<ul>
						<p>PIPELINE99 may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on our website. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. Please understand that, though we may have some small influence over our Account Holders, we fundamentally cannot control the online or offline actions of our Account Holders or other parties, especially when it comes to their use of information that you choose to disclose in moderated or unmoderated newsgroups and forums, known on the PIPELINE99 website as "Forums". While we will investigate complaints sent to customercare@pipeline99.com and take appropriate action with our Account Holders or other parties, we will typically not provide any information to third parties about our conversations with our Account Holders. We encourage people to resolve disputes directly with each other and discourage people from attempting to use PIPELINE99 to police their mailbox or newsgroup.</p>
						</ul>
						
						<h4>Referral Program</h4>
						<ul>
						<p>PIPELINE99 lists customer names, customer titles and testimonials from customers on its website. However, PIPELINE99 never posts any such information without obtaining the consent of the customer prior to posting such information. Customers may elect to use PIPELINE99’ affiliate program to refer and inform friends about the PIPELINE99 website and services. When using the affiliate program, PIPELINE99 requests the friend’s name, and email address. Using that information, PIPELINE99 will send the friend an email inviting them to visit the PIPELINE99 website and if they visit may send follow up emails.</p>
						</ul>
						
						<h4>Sharing of Information Collected</h4>
						<ul>
						<p>Only those PIPELINE99 employees trained in our security processes with managerial oversight would ever have access to your personal information which includes your name and login id. Our employees will not have access to your password. If you forget your password, you will be able to use our fully automated password recovery system to help you gain access to your account. We may use contractors or vendors to help us provide some of the services at our website. If we need to disclose personal information to them in order to provide these services, it is with the requirement that the information is kept confidential and is used only for those services. These contractors or vendors must comply with our Policy and all of the restrictions on PIPELINE99 information pertain to them as well.</p>
						
						<p>PIPELINE99 may provide access to your personal information to a successor of PIPELINE99 in connection with a sale, merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of the assets of the business, whether as a going concern or as part of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding. PIPELINE99 reserves the right to use or disclose your personal information if required by law or if PIPELINE99 reasonably believes that use or disclosure is necessary to protect its rights and/or to comply with any laws including a judicial proceeding or court order.</p>
						</ul>
						
						<h4>Customer Data</h4>
						<ul>
						<p>While you may electronically submit data and information to the PIPELINE99 Service for hosting and processing purposes, PIPELINE99 will not review, share, distribute or reference any of your data except as provided in the Terms and Conditions of Use, and as may be required by law. In accordance with the PIPELINE99 Terms and Conditions of Use, PIPELINE99 may access customer data without your consent for the purpose of providing the Service, preventing or addressing serious service or technical problems, at your request in connection with customer support matters, and as may be required by law.</p>
						</ul>
						
						<h4>Location of Data and Information</h4>
						<ul>
						<p>PIPELINE99 may transfer and access certain data and information collected from different locations around the world including the United States. This Policy shall apply even if data is transferred and accessed to or from other countries.</p>
						</ul>
						
						<h4>How We Keep Your Information Secure</h4>
						<ul>
						<p>PIPELINE99 uses reasonable efforts to protect your information from unauthorized access including a secure, encrypted connection (called an SSL connection) on all pages where you transmit personal data to us. Whenever you access any of your account pages or change any of your user information, it is done over an SSL connection to PIPELINE99. All data transfer to (upload) or from (download) our website will be via over a SSL connection using a current certificate.</p>
						
						<p>In addition, your data is stored at our secure data centers. We maintain our servers in secure data centers in two (2) separate geographical locations. The data centers are staffed twenty four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week. Your data is replicated in both data centers in real-time thus always providing a redundant backup of your data in the event that the Service should fail.</p>
						
						<p>In addition, if the redundant servers should fail, PIPELINE99 backs up data every hour to a separate backup production facility.</p>
						</ul>
						
						<h4>How You Can Access and Correct Your Information</h4>
						<ul>
						<p>You may update or change your personal information by logging in to https://http://pipeline99.com with your PIPELINE99 login id and password. Click on User Settings to edit your personal information. You may also email us at customercare@PIPELINE99.com to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us.</p>
